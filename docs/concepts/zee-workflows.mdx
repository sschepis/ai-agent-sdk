The Zero-Employee Enterprise (ZEE) is a new business model where traditional workforces are augmented by autonomous agents. The business logic behind ZEE makes the agents autonomous and able to solve complex problems.

A ZEE workflow contains a couple of components:

- The [Agents](/concepts/agents) that are used to solve the problem.
- The **planner** agent breaks down the final goal into smaller tasks and assigns them to the agents provided to the workflow.
- The **router** agent facilitates communication between all the agents via necessary context for the final goal.
- The **endgame** agent is the final agent that takes in the results from all the agents and formulates the final output.

> These agent names are reserved by the ZEE workflow. Make sure not to use these names for your agents.

## Creating a Workflow

To create a workflow, you need to create a new instance of the `ZeeWorkflow` class.

```typescript
const zee = new ZeeWorkflow({
    goal: "The goal of this workflow is to...",
    agents: [agent1, agent2],
    model: {
        provider: "openai",
        id: "gpt-4o-mini",
    },
    config: {
        temperature: 1,
        maxIterations: 10,
    },
});

const result = await zee.run();
```
